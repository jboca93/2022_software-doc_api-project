## GetMyWeather API and the getWeather Method

Using GetMyWeather's API, **getWeather*,* you can retrieve hyper-local weather data for your web applications or websites. For example, if you are developing a web application for outdoor adventurers, getWeather allows you to provide them with a weather forecast for a specific day, at a specific time and within a specific region. With your forecast, getWeather provides a *trust* value, a value that indicate's GetMyWeather's confidence in the accuracy of the forecast based on how far in the future or how large a region the user has specified.
