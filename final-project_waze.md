### Why Waze?

Waze is a community-driven navigation app. Drivers and riders from around the world work together every day to update the map based on traffic patterns, construction, accidents and more.

With Waze, you can guarantee that you will arrive at your destination in the quickest and most efficient way possible.

### Your Waze account

Once you create an account, you can save popular destinations like home, work and favorite stores. You can also track your impact on the Waze community by earning badges and accumulating points.

### Create a new account

1. Open the Waze app to your mobile device
2. Select **Get started**
3. Review the *Waze End User License Agreement* and select **Accept**
4. Create your account
  - If this is your first time logging in to the Waze app, select **Create an account**
  - If you have logged in to the Waze app on your device before using a different account, select **Use a different account.** By default, Waze will suggest your most recently used account as well.

<!--- In the above, I've tried to nest two bullets under step #4 -- during revisions, determine a new way to make this clearer (e.g. 4.1, 4.2 or something); Is there a way to do nested ordered lists in .md? --->
